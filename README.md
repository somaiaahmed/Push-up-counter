# Push-up-counter
Many of us like to push-up the exercise. but sometimes we get tired,
and donâ€™t make the right move down and up high enough, and don't 
remember the number of times. So, we made a counter to follow the 
rules. We choose Arduino to be the control circuit, an ultrasonic sensor 
to determine the number of times the body goes up and down and we 
will print the number of push-ups on the serial monitor.
